Simple Device Tree Overlay Loader
---------------------------------

This document briefly explains how to use the Simple Overlay Loader, provided
in drivers/misc/ovloader.c.


Compiling
---------
Compilation of the loader is controlled by the CONFIG_SIMPLE_OVERLAY_LOADER
option.

Overlay blobs can be compiled by invoking DTC with the '-@' flag, which will
enable the necessary extensions to the device tree format. The tree being
overlaid needs to have been compiled with the '-@' flag as well, to include
symbol information necessary to load overlays. Please refer to
Documentation/devicetree/overlay-notes.txt for information on creating overlay
source files.


Loading an Overlay
------------------
When the loader is present on a running system, it exposes the following sysfs
node as a means initiating the loading process:
/sys/devices/platform/ovloader.0/load

To load an overlay, userspace needs to write the filename of an overlay blob to
this node. The loader expects to find the overlay blobs in the standard system
firmware directory.


Example:
--------
The following command will cause /lib/firmware/msm8994-mtp-storage-overlay.dtb
to be loaded and applied to the live device tree:

# echo msm8994-mtp-storage-overlay.dtb > /sys/devices/platform/ovloader.0/load
